# SearchBox Sync

![Logo](/src/chrome/skin/classic/icon.png?raw=true) SearchBox Sync is an add-on for Mozilla Firefox. It automatically updates the search bar with your search text whenever you search from a web page directly. The most common search engines (Google, Yahoo!, Live Search, YouTube, ...) are automatically synchronized, and custom rules can easily be added for those that are not detected.
